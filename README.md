# PingMeMaybe

## Description
PingMeMaybe is my experiment of building a high scale, low latency bulk notifications handling system.
Inspiration for the architecture is drawn from this [medium article](https://amanmadhukar.medium.com/building-a-scalable-cloud-native-notification-system-a4e64b42d671) by @madhukaraman.
